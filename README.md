# food-models

**This repository contains models that are built using food101 dataset. The original source of data is [here](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/).**

The projects are:

1. Binary food vision (`binary-food-vision.ipynp`) - binary image classification: deep learning model which is built using Keras Sequential API. 

2. Fast Food Vision (`fast-food-vision.ipynb`) - multiclass (10 classes) image classification: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning model which is built using Keras Functional API.

3. Fast Food Vision 2.0 (`transef-learning-fast-food-vision.ipynb`) - multiclass (10 classes) image classification: the model with the plroblem similar to the previous one, but now it is built using transef learning with further rine-tuning. Tested models are: . The best scored model - .

4. Fast Food Detector (`fast-food-object-detection.ipynb`) - Object Detection model which is built using TensorFlow Object Detection API and TensorFlow Garden Models.
